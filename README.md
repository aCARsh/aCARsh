Hey! I am Akarsh (usually pronounced as aCARsh or aCURsh, but as long as I get that you are callling me, its fine. ~~Just dont dare call me Akash~~)
I am currently an undergraduate physics student at the University of Oxford
I spend my time studying physics, reading and thinking about philosophical questions, watching anime ~~unless i am doomscrolling~~
I dont know why i am making a github profile, but here we are....
